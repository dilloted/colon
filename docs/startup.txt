Each time you need to start a new instance of Klipper there are some necesary steps that have to happen in order to get everything going on smoothly.
Here I am just going to list out some of those tasks so that at a later point I can go ahead and turn that into an install.sh file that does most of this for me. 


Current Setup

Flash RPI with current version of Klipper
Add RPi to the DHCP/DNS server so that it can be accessed in the future
Klipper-Backup ðŸ’¾ install script
Pull Colon repo from source
Create printer.cfg file and find MCU ID
Install RPI camera python modules
Run RPI Update

Paper bed leveling
